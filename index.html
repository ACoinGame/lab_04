      <h2>January 16</h2>
      <p>
        I tell myself I need to wake up at 4am today, but I feel lazy and wake
        up one hour late. I still have videos to catch up for the quiz in ACIT
        1620. I go through all of them in one hour before I leave my home. It
        is
        <em>terrible</em>! I <em>always</em> make note but all these CIT
        ourses have insnae amount of readings in ACIT 1620. I do not have time
        to make note for each reading. As expected, I am unsure of my answers
        during the quiz. I answer some of them wrong.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>NOTE:</strong> you need to study harder and wake up once your
        alarm rings!
